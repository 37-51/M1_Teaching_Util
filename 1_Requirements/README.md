# Description
Last few years have been challenging for everyone of us due to "CORONA".So many of the biotech companies have been woking to make vaccines available to everyone.So government is planning to make it simple to everyone.So here i proposed a design that instead of making complex creating a local servers which can be done quickly and efficiently which also decrease the chance of crashing and hacking.So this project helpful for registering vaccine easily and quickly.
# Requirements
As we know due to heavy population there will be more number of people getting registering for vaccines so the number of people getting registered and number of people completed vaccination will be more so there will be chance of server crash.Here this project helps to create a local servers where the user get registered after reaching the max server reach it connects to main server and corresponding to this each vaccine centre will operate locally  and this can be done online and whatever the vaccine he required can register in this local server.Here the registrations can be done on day time and data acquired can be done on night.Once the registration and after successful verification the data is kept for future use.
