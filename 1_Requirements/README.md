# Description
Last few years have been challenging for everyone of us due to "CORONA".So many of the biotech companies have been woking to make vaccines available to everyone.So government is planning to make it simple to everyone.So here i proposed a design that instead of making complex creating a local servers which can be done quickly and efficiently which also decrease the chance of crashing and hacking.So this project helpful for registering vaccine easily and quickly.
# Requirements
As we know due to heavy population there will be more number of people getting
Each vaccine centre will operate locally to register and allot vaccines. The basic registration can be done online and schedules are set as desired by the patient. Assuming a vaccination centre can vaccinate around 100 people in a day. The data handling for online basic registration will be mostly done in the day time and the data acquired by the local centres of vaccinated people can be handled in the night.

The local server must store the data of around 100 people where the allocated online registration data will be loaded onto the local server of that local centre. Verification of the data is done based on the details provided by the patient. Once completed, the data of the vaccinated will be sent back for future use and reference.
